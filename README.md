# Questions:

1. What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?
https://github.com/sidv2003-2161377/cfa-app

2. What API did you use and why?
Free NBA Players, this is because I enjoy watching the NBA and just thought it was something I have not seen too much of in terms of making a project

3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.
Well the application can be used to search for the players but also provides information about them such as the team they belong(ed) to, the position they play(ed) in and so, along with filters to filter by position and/or teams. An application using this website can quickly get this information in order to create reports about it and even fetch the player if their stats are recorded on the app to display the player and the statistics. 

4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.
To make it mobile friendly, I made it so that the website can adjust according to the screen size of the device. To make it responsive, it was important ensuring that the website updated live as soon as a search was performed.

5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?
I can make the app using neutral colors (which I did, since it is in grayscale) to help ensure color-blind people are not experiencing it differently. I can also implement a text-to-voice feature in the future to deal with disabilities like blindness. 

6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them?
I would link another API with it to provide statistics, along with adding photos and making it more informative than just using a single API to provide more information about the players themselves. I would also make it look a lot fancier than just the simple search bar and tabular format to make it seem more user-friendly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
